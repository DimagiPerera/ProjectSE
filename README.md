Admin information will be saved in the database via the seed file when the server starts. The admin may then access the system. Additionally, he or she can create users byÂ giving them a role and some basic data. The appropriate users then receive an email with a temporary password. They can then use that temporary password to get into the system after which they will be instantly forwarded to the register page, where they must enter the necessary information and change their password. Users will be automatically logged out of the system after changing their passwords. The system will then direct users based on their account type after the users log in again using their new credentials.
